# ABC-Cars

## Project Overview

We have been approached by the ABC Cars Pte Ltd. We are tasked to build a website portal for the sole purpose of selling the company products, the cars. The requirements is that the user will be able to register in the portal using the registration page. The users of the portal can search using Make Page. Also, they can also view the car information after searching. The Used Car Sales Portal allow users to login and post a car for sale.
